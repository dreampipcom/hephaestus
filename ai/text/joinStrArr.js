    "# Presidential Program 0: IN SEARCH OF 1 - Culture for Funktion Ones (WIP)",
    "",
    "## Introduction",
    "",
    "Brazil is a country rich in cultural diversity and artistic talent. However, often, these talents do not have the opportunity to shine due to the lack of adequate infrastructure. The program 'IN SEARCH OF 1 - Culture for Funktion Ones' aims to reverse this reality, providing local artists with the necessary structure so they can perform in a dignified and professional manner, while also respecting social coexistence norms.",
    "",
    "## Objective",
    "",
    "Our goal is to democratize access to culture and high-quality music throughout the national territory. With an investment of 300 million reais, which would be equivalent to a single show by an international artist like Madonna, we could acquire at least 4,000 Funktion One sound systems. These systems would be distributed among clubs and bars in all regions of Brazil, including more distant and hard-to-reach municipalities.",
    "",
    "## Sound Infrastructure",
    "",
    "Funktion One sound systems are recognized worldwide for their superior quality. By installing these systems in clubs and bars, we ensure that local artists have the opportunity to perform on high-quality stages, elevating the level of performances and consequently attracting more audiences and encouraging local culture.",
    "",
    "## National Coverage",
    "",
    "This program will not be restricted to large cities. Our goal is to ensure 100% municipal coverage, including the most remote areas of the Brazilian interior. All municipalities will have at least one place equipped with the latest sound systems, ensuring that no artist needs to migrate to large centers to gain visibility.",
    "",
    "## Investment in Acoustic Insulation",
    "",
    "In addition to the acquisition of sound systems, a significant portion of the investment will be allocated to the soundproofing of these venues and the residences of artists. This will allow performances to take place without disturbing the neighborhood, ensuring everyone's right to peace and quiet. Living in a mansion to be able to be an artist is a privilege that few can afford, and our proposal is to make artistic practice more accessible and democratic.",
    "",
    "## Incentive to Local Production",
    "",
    "With access to high-quality equipment, local artists will have more opportunities to develop their careers. In addition to live performances, these systems will enable quality recordings, fostering local musical and artistic production. Brazilian culture is one of the richest in the world, and we must provide our artists with the necessary tools to express their full potential.",
    "",
    "## Partnerships and Training",
    "",
    "To ensure the success of the program, we will establish partnerships with cultural producers, NGOs, and educational institutions. We will offer training courses for sound technicians and local producers, ensuring that the equipment is used optimally and that the local artistic community is prepared to make the most of these resources.",
    "",
    "## Sustainability and Maintenance",
    "",
    "Finally, the program will include a maintenance and sustainability plan for the equipment. We will establish preventive and corrective maintenance contracts, ensuring that the sound systems remain in perfect working condition. In addition, we will encourage the adoption of sustainable practices, reducing environmental impact and promoting social responsibility.",
    "",
    "## Conclusion",
    "",
    "The program EM BUSCA DO 1 - Culture for Funktion Ones represents a significant step towards the democratization of culture in Brazil. With intelligent and strategic investment, we can transform the reality of thousands of artists and communities across the country. Music and art have the power to unite, inspire, and transform, and it is our duty as a nation to provide the necessary conditions for our talent to be heard and appreciated.",

    "# Presidential Program -1: AXIOMA FESTAS (WIP)",
    "",
    "## Introduction",
    "",
    "The AXIOMA FESTAS Program aims to strengthen national security and ensure that the entry of foreigners into national territory occurs in an orderly and safe manner. This program proposes a monitoring and technological analysis system for all visa applicants, except those seeking humanitarian asylum. Through artificial supervision, using CCTV and 24/7 audio monitoring for a period of one year, we can ensure that only individuals with legitimate intentions and appropriate behaviors are allowed to enter the country.",
    "",
    "## Objective",
    "",
    "The main objective of AXIOMA FESTAS is to protect the integrity and security of the national territory, preventing the entry of individuals who may pose a threat. By implementing a rigorous monitoring system and technological analysis, we intend to effectively filter visa applicants, ensuring that only those who pass the security criteria enter the country.",
    "",
    "## Methodology",
    "",
    "For the execution of AXIOMA FESTAS, the collaboration between states (MUV) will be used in sharing the continuous monitoring system through CCTV cameras and audio recording. This monitoring should be offered from the date of the request + the period of 1 year prior to it, for each visa applicant. The collected data will be analyzed by an advanced artificial intelligence, capable of identifying suspicious behaviors and potential threats. The analysis will include speech patterns, daily activities, and social interactions.",
    "",
    "## Exceptions",
    "",
    "The program provides exceptions for individuals seeking humanitarian asylum. These applicants will undergo a one-year quarantine period in dedicated villages, where they can be monitored in a controlled environment. This measure aims to ensure the safety of both the applicants and the national population, while offering a safe haven for those who truly need it.",
    "",
    "## Implementation",
    "",
    "The implementation of AXIOMA FESTAS will be carried out in phases. In the first phase, intentions for inclusion in a specific MVU Letter will be announced through the main embassies and consulates. The second phase will involve the development (together with Robocob Sensor) and complete integration of the artificial analysis system, ensuring that all collected data is processed fairly, humanely, efficiently, and safely. In the third phase, visa request channels for foreigners will be offered, the filter will be implemented, and coverage will be expanded to include all entry points into the national territory, such as airports and ports.",
    "",
    "## Expected Benefits",
    "",
    "With the implementation of AXIOMA FESTAS, a significant reduction is expected in the entry of individuals who may pose a threat to national security and a disruption to national values (order, progress, and freedom of expression). Additionally, the program will provide a more efficient and fair screening of visa applicants, allowing those with legitimate intentions and appropriate behaviors to enter the country. In the long term, this program will contribute to the maintenance of freedoms, peace, and security within the national territory.",
    "",
    "## Ethical Considerations",
    "",
    "We recognize that the implementation of such a rigorous monitoring system raises important ethical questions. Therefore, we will ensure that all privacy measures are respected and that the use of the collected data is strictly limited to the purposes of national security and the preservation of Western values. Oversight and audit mechanisms will be established to ensure transparency and accountability in the use of the system.",
    "",
    "## Conclusion",
    "",
    "The AXIOMA FESTAS represents an important step in modernizing and strengthening national security. Through the use of advanced technology and artificial intelligence, we can better protect our borders and ensure that only individuals with legitimate intentions and appropriate behaviors enter the country. This program is a demonstration of our commitment to the safety and well-being of all citizens.",
